## 3. Integration

### 3.1 App Module Updates
Added both modules to `src/app.module.ts`:
```typescript
import { AdminModule } from './modules/admin/admin.module';
import { DisputesModule } from './modules/disputes/disputes.module';

@Module({
  imports: [
    // ... other modules
    AdminModule,
    DisputesModule,
  ],
})
```

---

## 4. Security & Access Control

### 4.1 Admin Endpoints
- **All admin endpoints require:** `@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN)`
- Protected by `JwtAuthGuard` and `RolesGuard`
- Only authenticated admin users can access

### 4.2 Dispute Endpoints
- **Authentication:** All endpoints require JWT authentication
- **Authorization:**
  - Parties to dispute can view, add evidence, escalate
  - Only admins can resolve disputes
  - Only admins can change certain statuses
  - Raiser or admin can close disputes

---

## 5. Business Logic

### 5.1 Admin Operations

**User Management:**
- Suspend users temporarily or permanently
- Activation reverses suspension
- Admin verification for trusted users
- Soft delete preserves data integrity

**Payment Management:**
- Track failed payments
- Process refunds with reason tracking
- Revenue analytics by period
- Platform fee calculations

**System Health:**
- Health score calculation (0-100)
- Monitors: failed payments, failed withdrawals, open disputes, flagged content
- Status: healthy (>80), warning (50-80), critical (<50)

### 5.2 Dispute Operations

**Dispute Creation:**
1. Validates contract exists
2. Verifies user is a party to contract
3. Checks for existing active dispute
4. Creates dispute with OPEN status
5. Updates contract status to DISPUTED

**Dispute Resolution:**
1. Admin reviews evidence
2. Makes resolution decision
3. Processes refunds if applicable
4. Updates contract status
5. Logs resolution details

**Escalation Process:**
- Parties can escalate open disputes
- Moves to admin review queue
- Tracks escalation notes and timestamp

## Summary

The admin and disputes modules provide comprehensive platform management and conflict resolution capabilities. The admin module gives platform administrators full oversight and control over users, payments, jobs, contracts, and system health. The disputes module enables fair resolution of conflicts between clients and freelancers with proper evidence handling and admin oversight.

Both modules follow NestJS best practices, include proper authentication/authorization, comprehensive logging, and detailed API documentation.
