# Withdrawal Auto-Processing Implementation

## 🚀 Overview

The withdrawal system now supports **automatic processing** without admin approval. When a freelancer requests a withdrawal, the system immediately creates a Stripe transfer and completes the withdrawal.

---

## ✅ What Changed

### **Before (Manual Processing):**
```
1. Freelancer creates withdrawal → Status: PENDING
2. Admin reviews request → Calls /withdrawals/:id/process
3. Stripe transfer created → Status: PROCESSING
4. Admin confirms → Calls /withdrawals/:id/complete
5. Status: COMPLETED
```

### **After (Auto-Processing):**
```
1. Freelancer creates withdrawal
2. System automatically:
   - Deducts balance
   - Creates Stripe transfer
   - Updates status: PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED
3. Done! (All in one request)
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Enable/Disable Auto-Processing:**

File: `src/modules/withdrawals/withdrawals.service.ts`

```typescript
export class WithdrawalsService {
  // Set to true for auto-processing, false for manual admin approval
  private readonly AUTO_PROCESS_WITHDRAWALS = true;
}
```

**Options:**
- `true` - Auto-process all Stripe withdrawals (recommended for high volume)
- `false` - Require admin approval for each withdrawal (more control)

---

## 📊 Flow Diagram

### **Auto-Processing Flow:**

```
POST /api/withdrawals
    ↓
Validate balance & limits
    ↓
Deduct from availableBalance (atomic)
    ↓
Save withdrawal (status: PENDING)
    ↓
[AUTO-PROCESSING STARTS]
    ↓
Create Stripe Transfer
    ↓
Update status: PROCESSING
    ↓
Update status: COMPLETED
    ↓
Send completion notification
    ↓
Return completed withdrawal

[If Stripe fails]
    ↓
Refund balance
    ↓
Mark withdrawal: FAILED
    ↓
Throw error to user
```

## 🎯 API Behavior

### **Freelancer Creates Withdrawal:**

**Request:**
```bash
POST /api/withdrawals
Authorization: Bearer {freelancer_jwt}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 100,
  "method": "stripe",
  "stripeAccountId": "acct_1234567890",
  "description": "September earnings"
}
```

**Response (Auto-Processing Enabled):**
```json
{
  "_id": "674f1234567890abcdef",
  "status": "completed",           // ✅ Already completed!
  "amount": 100,
  "finalAmount": 96.80,
  "processingFee": 3.20,
  "stripeTransferId": "tr_1234567890",  // ✅ Transfer created
  "processedAt": "2025-10-06T21:00:00.000Z",
  "completedAt": "2025-10-06T21:00:01.000Z",
  "requestedAt": "2025-10-06T21:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Response (Auto-Processing Disabled):**
```json
{
  "_id": "674f1234567890abcdef",
  "status": "pending",             // ⏳ Waiting for admin
  "amount": 100,
  "finalAmount": 96.80,
  "processingFee": 3.20,
  "requestedAt": "2025-10-06T21:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## 🚨 Error Handling

### **Stripe Transfer Fails:**

If the Stripe transfer fails during auto-processing:

1. ✅ **Balance is automatically refunded**
2. ✅ **Withdrawal marked as FAILED**
3. ✅ **Error message stored**
4. ❌ **User receives error response**

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Withdrawal failed: No such connected account: acct_invalid. Your balance has been refunded.",
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

**Database State:**
- Withdrawal: `status: "failed"`, `errorMessage: "..."`
- User Balance: **Refunded** (no money lost)

## 🔍 Monitoring & Verification

### **Check Logs:**

```bash
# Look for these log messages:
[WithdrawalsService] Withdrawal auto-processing: ENABLED
[WithdrawalsService] Auto-processing withdrawal 674f... with Stripe transfer...
[WithdrawalsService] Stripe transfer created automatically: tr_123...
[WithdrawalsService] Withdrawal 674f... auto-processed and completed successfully
```

### **Check Database:**

```javascript
// Successful auto-processed withdrawal:
{
  status: "completed",
  stripeTransferId: "tr_1234567890",
  requestedAt: "2025-10-06T21:00:00.000Z",
  processedAt: "2025-10-06T21:00:00.000Z",    // Same time
  completedAt: "2025-10-06T21:00:01.000Z"     // 1 second later
}
```

### **Check Stripe Dashboard:**

1. **Platform Account → Payments → Transfers**
   - See transfer OUT to connected account
   - Amount: finalAmount (after fees)
   - Status: Paid

2. **Connected Account → Balance**
   - Balance increased by finalAmount
   - Available for payout to bank

---

## 🛡️ Security & Safety

### **Built-in Protections:**

1. **Balance Validation** - Ensures sufficient funds before processing
2. **Atomic Deduction** - Prevents double withdrawals (race conditions)
3. **Idempotency Keys** - Prevents duplicate requests
4. **Maximum Limits** - Max 3 pending withdrawals per user
5. **Minimum Amounts** - Final amount must be ≥ $10
6. **Automatic Rollback** - Refunds if Stripe fails
7. **Audit Logging** - All actions tracked in transaction log

### **Rate Limiting (Recommended):**

Add to controller for extra safety:

```typescript
@UseGuards(ThrottlerGuard)
@Throttle(5, 60) // Max 5 withdrawal requests per minute
@Post()
async create(...) { ... }
```

---

## 🔄 Admin Endpoints (Still Available)

Even with auto-processing enabled, admin endpoints remain available for:

- **Viewing all withdrawals:** `GET /withdrawals`
- **Viewing details:** `GET /withdrawals/:id`
- **Manual processing:** `PATCH /withdrawals/:id/process` (for edge cases)
- **Manual completion:** `PATCH /withdrawals/:id/complete` (if needed)
- **Marking as failed:** `PATCH /withdrawals/:id/fail` (manual refund)

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Auto-Processing:**

```bash
# 1. Create withdrawal (should auto-complete)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/withdrawals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FREELANCER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 50,
    "method": "stripe",
    "stripeAccountId": "acct_test_123"
  }'

# Expected: Status should be "completed" immediately
# Expected: Response includes "stripeTransferId"
# Expected: Balance deducted from user account
```

### **Test Failure Scenario:**

```bash
# Use invalid Stripe account ID
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/withdrawals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FREELANCER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 50,
    "method": "stripe",
    "stripeAccountId": "acct_invalid_123"
  }'

# Expected: 400 error returned
# Expected: Balance refunded automatically
# Expected: Withdrawal marked as "failed" in database
```

## 📝 Migration Notes

### **Existing Pending Withdrawals:**

If you have pending withdrawals before enabling auto-processing:

1. They remain in "pending" status
2. Admins can still manually process them
3. New withdrawals will be auto-processed
4. No migration needed

### **Switching Back to Manual:**

To revert to manual approval:

```typescript
private readonly AUTO_PROCESS_WITHDRAWALS = false;
```

- Restart the service
- New withdrawals will be "pending"
- Auto-processing stops
- Admin approval required again

---
