## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
Set these in your Postman environment:
```
base_url = http://localhost:3000
access_token = [from login]
admin_token = [from admin login]
```

### 2. Auto-Save IDs
The collection automatically saves IDs from responses:
- `payment_method_id` from save payment method
- `payment_id` from create payment
- `payment_intent_id` from create intent
- `withdrawal_id` from create withdrawal

### 3. Testing in Order
Follow this sequence for best results:
1. Payment Methods ‚Üí Payments ‚Üí Withdrawals
2. Create resources before testing queries
3. Test admin actions after regular operations

### 4. Webhook Testing
Use Stripe CLI for local webhook testing:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/payments/webhook
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
```

### 5. Error Handling
Check these when requests fail:
- Valid authentication token
- Correct user role
- Required IDs exist (contract, milestone, etc.)
- Stripe test mode enabled
- Valid test card numbers
