# Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure proper implementation and deployment of the job status improvements.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Review
- [ ] Review all changes in `BACKEND_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- [ ] Verify new job statuses in `job-status.enum.ts`
- [ ] Check contract validation logic in `contracts.service.ts`
- [ ] Verify proposal acceptance flow in `proposals.service.ts`
- [ ] Review close/reopen logic in `jobs.service.ts`
- [ ] Confirm unique index on `contractId` in `job.schema.ts`

### Testing
- [ ] Test creating a contract for a job
- [ ] Test preventing duplicate contract creation (should fail)
- [ ] Test accepting a proposal (status should be AWAITING_CONTRACT)
- [ ] Test creating contract after accepting proposal
- [ ] Test closing an open job (status should be CLOSED)
- [ ] Test reopening a closed job
- [ ] Test all API endpoints still work correctly

### Documentation Review
- [ ] Read through `BACKEND_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- [ ] Read through `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Review `JOB_STATUS_REFERENCE.md`
- [ ] Check `SUMMARY.md` for overview

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backup
- [ ] Create full database backup
- [ ] Document backup location and timestamp
- [ ] Test backup restoration (optional but recommended)

### Step 2: Deploy Code
- [ ] Pull latest code from repository
- [ ] Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
- [ ] Check for compilation errors

### Step 3: Migration (Development)
- [ ] Run dry run: `npm run migrate:job-status -- --dry-run`
- [ ] Review dry run output for issues
- [ ] Document number of jobs to be updated
- [ ] Run actual migration: `npm run migrate:job-status`
- [ ] Verify migration output
- [ ] Check database for correct status values

### Step 4: Testing (Development)
- [ ] Test job creation and publishing
- [ ] Test proposal submission and acceptance
- [ ] Test contract creation
- [ ] Test job closure
- [ ] Test all user workflows end-to-end
- [ ] Check application logs for errors

### Step 5: Staging Deployment
- [ ] Repeat Steps 1-4 on staging environment
- [ ] Perform comprehensive testing
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes
- [ ] Test with real-world scenarios

### Step 6: Production Deployment
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window (if possible)
- [ ] Notify users of potential downtime (if applicable)
- [ ] Deploy code to production
- [ ] Run migration on production database
- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Verify critical workflows
- [ ] Check error tracking systems

---

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (First 15 minutes)
- [ ] Application is running without errors
- [ ] Users can access the platform
- [ ] New jobs can be created
- [ ] Proposals can be submitted
- [ ] Contracts can be created
- [ ] No database errors in logs

### Short-term Monitoring (First 24 hours)
- [ ] Monitor error logs for status-related issues
- [ ] Check database for unexpected status values
- [ ] Verify no jobs stuck in invalid states
- [ ] Monitor user feedback/complaints
- [ ] Check that new contracts are being created successfully
- [ ] Verify old contracts continue to function

### Database Validation
```javascript
// Run these queries to verify data integrity

// Count jobs by status
db.jobs.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$status", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])

// Find any jobs with duplicate contracts (should return 0)
db.contracts.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$jobId", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $match: { count: { $gt: 1 } } }
])

// Verify all contracted jobs have valid contracts
db.jobs.aggregate([
  { 
    $match: { 
      status: "contracted",
      contractId: { $ne: null }
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "contracts",
      localField: "contractId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "contract"
    }
  },
  {
    $match: {
      contract: { $size: 0 } // Should return 0 results
    }
  }
])
```

## üêõ Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Arise:

#### Option 1: Database Rollback (Recommended)
1. [ ] Stop the application
2. [ ] Restore from backup taken in Step 1
3. [ ] Redeploy previous code version
4. [ ] Restart application
5. [ ] Verify restoration

#### Option 2: Code Rollback Only
1. [ ] Checkout previous code commit
2. [ ] Rebuild application
3. [ ] Restart application
4. [ ] Run migration rollback: `npm run migrate:job-status -- --rollback`

#### Option 3: Manual Fix
1. [ ] Identify specific issue
2. [ ] Apply hotfix to code
3. [ ] Redeploy
4. [ ] Or fix data directly in database

## üìä Success Metrics

### Week 1
- [ ] Zero critical errors related to job statuses
