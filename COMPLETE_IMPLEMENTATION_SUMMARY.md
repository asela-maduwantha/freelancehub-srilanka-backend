## 🔐 Security & Access Control

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication on all endpoints
- `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)` applied

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Roles: CLIENT, FREELANCER, ADMIN
- `@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN)` for admin-only endpoints
- Proper permission checks in service layer

### Data Protection
- Soft deletes preserve data integrity
- Audit trails on critical operations
- User access validation before data exposure

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### New/Enhanced Schemas

**Payment Schema:**
- Added `totalClientCharge` field
- Tracks platform fee separately

**Contract Schema:**
- Added `platformFeeAmount` field
- Added `totalClientCharge` field
- Added `usesLegacyFeeCalculation` flag for migration

**Withdrawal Schema:**
- Added `metadata` field
- Added `idempotencyKey` with unique index

**Dispute Schema:**
- Complete dispute management structure
- Evidence array support
- Status tracking
- Resolution details

---

## 🔄 Business Logic

### Payment Flow
1. Client creates milestone payment
2. Total charge = contract amount + platform fee (10%)
3. Client charged: totalClientCharge
4. Freelancer receives: contract amount (full)
5. Platform receives: platform fee

### Withdrawal Flow
1. Freelancer requests withdrawal
2. Balance validated and deducted immediately
3. Status: PENDING
4. Stripe processes withdrawal
5. On success: Status = COMPLETED
6. On failure: Balance refunded, Status = FAILED

### Dispute Flow
1. Party raises dispute
2. Contract status = DISPUTED
3. Parties can add evidence
4. Either party can escalate
5. Admin reviews and resolves
6. Contract status restored
7. Refunds processed if applicable

## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

The FreelanceHub backend is now feature-complete with all major systems implemented. The codebase follows NestJS best practices, includes proper error handling, comprehensive logging, and detailed API documentation. All modules are properly integrated and there are no compilation errors.

The payment/withdrawal system has been fixed to handle race conditions and calculate platform fees correctly. The admin module provides full platform oversight capabilities. The dispute system enables fair conflict resolution between parties.

**Next steps should focus on:**
1. Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
2. Frontend implementation
3. Database migration for fee structure changes
4. Production deployment planning
