## üí° Business Rules

### One Job = One Contract ‚úÖ
- A job can have only ONE contract
- Enforced at application and database level
- Attempting to create second contract throws error

### Contract Prerequisites
- Job must be in `AWAITING_CONTRACT` or `IN_PROGRESS` status
- Job must have an accepted proposal
- Job must NOT already have a contract

### Proposal Acceptance
- Job must be `OPEN`
- Only one proposal can be accepted
- All other proposals automatically rejected
- Job status changes to `AWAITING_CONTRACT`

## üîç Status Queries

### Find jobs by status (MongoDB)
```javascript
// All open jobs
db.jobs.find({ status: "open" })

// Jobs waiting for contracts
db.jobs.find({ status: "awaiting-contract" })

// Active contracts
db.jobs.find({ status: "contracted" })

// All completed work
db.jobs.find({ status: "completed" })
```

### Find jobs with issues
```javascript
// Jobs with status mismatch
db.jobs.find({ 
  status: "contracted", 
  contractId: null 
})

// Jobs with multiple contracts (should be 0)
db.contracts.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$jobId", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $match: { count: { $gt: 1 } } }
])
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Job stuck in AWAITING_CONTRACT
**Cause**: Client accepted proposal but didn't create contract  
**Fix**: Client needs to create contract, or cancel job

### Job shows CONTRACTED but no contract exists
**Cause**: Data corruption or migration issue  
**Fix**: Set status to AWAITING_CONTRACT or recreate contract

### Cannot create contract
**Check**: 
1. Is job status AWAITING_CONTRACT or IN_PROGRESS?
2. Does job already have a contractId?
3. Is proposal status "accepted"?
